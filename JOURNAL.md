I followed the guide and completed the PCB quickly. Added a few things from my side. I would also start designing the case for this PCB in CAD for this project. See the progress below

## 11/9/2025 11:23 AM - Made the CAD model  

I started with the CAD for the first time. I have made a simple case for the USB hub PCB. Here are the images of the work done. I'll also add the models to my github.
